# MobileAppsOnboarding
Guidelines with some boilerplate about how to distribute your Android and iOS mobile apps outside the stores (GooglePlay, AppStore).

Using this repository's boilerplate HTML files with the right application [configuration values], you can host and share your own one pagers anywhere as static pages and share only a single link which opens up as needed on the respective Desktop/Android/iOS patforms.

The sample below shows the case when you host these pages from localhost (of course you'd better host if publicly, it is only for demo purpose):
