[HockeyApp.net](hockeyapp.net) is a convenient distribution platform for amongst others for Android apps, mainly when it is about using non-store based channels (i.e. not using the GooglePlay), just simply sharing your app with a selected target audience.

- to share your app to registered users only
- to have your users download the app either from their WEB interface or their dedicated container HockeyApp application
- to let anyone download your application file (APK) via a public link, if you set accessibility to public for your managed application
- to follow usage/download analytics for your app
